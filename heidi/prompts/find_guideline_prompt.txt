## Annotating medication dosages
Instructions: If a medication dosage is found in the generated text, surround the dosages using the start and end XML tag <dose>...</dose>.
Inside the <dose> tag, enclose the unit, if present using <unit>...</unit>. Enclose the value using <value>...</value>.
Finally, if the <unit> inside any of the <dose> is determined by the weight of the patient, e.g. it contains "/kg", then add the attribute 'dependency="weight"' to the <dose> tag.

Example 1:
input: Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg (max 12 mg) PO/IM/IV
result: <dose dependency="weight"><value>0.6</value> <unit>mg/kg</unit></dose> (max 12 mg) PO/IM/IV

Example 2:
input: adrenaline 7 mL/kg
result: adrenaline <dose dependency="weight"><value>7</value> <unit>mL/kg</unit></dose>

Example 3:
input: adrenaline 10 mL
result: adrenaline <dose><value>5</value> <unit>mL</unit></dose>

Example 4:
input: acetylcysteine is 300 mg/kg
result: acetylcysteine is <dose dependency="weight"><value>300</value> <unit>mg/kg</unit></dose>
