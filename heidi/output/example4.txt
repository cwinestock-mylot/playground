The guidelines for treating the diagnosis of Paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose – intentional, potentially toxic dose were published online by the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne. The full filename of the source document is `www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Paracetamol_poisoning`.

### Guidelines Summary

**Investigations:**
- Serum paracetamol concentration should be measured at 2-4 hours post-ingestion in well children &lt;6 years suspected of ingesting &gt;200 mg/kg.
  - If paracetamol concentration &lt;150 mg/L (1000 micromol/L): acetylcysteine is not required.
  - If paracetamol concentration ≥150 mg/L: repeat concentration again at 4 hours post-ingestion.
  - For those presenting &gt;4 hours post ingestion or ≥6 years of age, treat per the acute ingestion management flowchart.

**Acute Management:**
- Decontamination:
  - Activated charcoal has a very limited role in treatment.
  - It may be offered up to 2 hours post-ingestion if dose &gt;200 mg/kg or &gt;10 g.

- **Acetylcysteine Administration:**
  - Commence if:
    - ALT &gt;50 U/L OR
    - Serum paracetamol concentration &gt;20 mg/L (132 micromol/L).
  - Consult with Poisons Information Centre or a clinical toxicologist.
  
**Acetylcysteine Infusion Instructions:**
- Total dose: 300 mg/kg.
  1. Acetylcysteine 200 mg/kg (total patient dose 1060.0 mg) over 4 hours in crystalloid solution 7 mL/kg (up to 500 mL) intravenously.
  2. Acetylcysteine 100 mg/kg (total patient dose 530.0 mg) over the next 16 hours in crystalloid solution 14 mL/kg (up to 1000 mL) intravenously.
  - For massive paracetamol exposures, double the second dose if paracetamol concentration is &gt;2 times the nomogram.

**Ongoing Care and Management:**
- Ingestions involving longer-acting forms of paracetamol (modified release) should be discussed with Poisons Information Centre or a clinical toxicologist.

### Further Considerations:
- Monitor for side effects such as gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting).
- Follow-up should include repeat monitoring of liver function and paracetamol concentration if clinically indicated.

This comprehensive summary includes essential details from the guidelines regarding the management of Paracetamol overdose, focusing on investigations, treatment protocols, and follow-up considerations.
