The guidelines for treating moderate croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) were published online by the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne. The full filename of the source document is `www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/croup_laryngotracheobronchitis`.

### Guidelines for Moderate Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis)

#### Investigations
- Croup is a clinical diagnosis. Investigations such as respiratory swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, X-rays, and blood tests are **not** indicated in typical presentations. Consider appropriate investigations if there is concern for differential diagnoses.

#### Treatment
- **Minimise distress** to avoid worsening symptoms. Limit interventions that do not impact acute management.
- Keep the child with caregivers to reduce distress and maintain a quiet environment with moderate lighting.
- Children will adopt a comfortable position to minimize airway obstruction; do not change this.

#### Medication
- **Moderate:**
  - Oral steroids: Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg (total patient dose 1.815 mg) oral or prednisolone 1 mg/kg (total patient dose 12.1 mg) oral.
  - Consider nebulised adrenaline if symptoms are persistent or worsening.

#### Disposition
- Children can be discharged home once stridor is free at rest.
- A period of observation of 3 hours is required after nebulised adrenaline to ensure no recurrence of symptoms.
- Consider a longer period of observation for children who:
  - Present overnight.
  - Have limited access to medical care.
  - Present with stridor more than once during the same illness.
  - Have risk factors for severe croup.

#### Consultations and Transfers
- **Consult a local paediatric team when:**
  - Severe airway obstruction is present.
  - The child has risk factors or any doubt about diagnosis.
  - The child is less than 6 months of age.
  - There is no improvement with nebulised adrenaline.

- **Consider transfer when:**
  - There is no improvement following nebulised adrenaline.
  - The child requires repeated doses of nebulised adrenaline.
  - The child requires care above the level of comfort of the local hospital.
