The guidelines for treating moderate croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) were published online by the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne. The source document is titled "www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/croup_laryngotracheobronchitis".

### Investigations
Croup is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Investigations such as respiratory swab or nasopharyngeal aspirate, X-rays, and blood tests are **not indicated** in typical presentations. Consider appropriate investigations if there is concern for differential diagnoses.

### Treatment
- **Minimise distress** to avoid worsening symptoms; limit interventions that do not impact acute management.
- Keep the child with caregivers to reduce distress.
- Maintain a quiet environment with moderate lighting.
- Allow children to adopt a position of comfort that minimizes airway obstruction.

**Medications**
- **Moderate:**  
  - **Oral steroids:** Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg (total patient dose 2.13 mg) oral or prednisolone 1 mg/kg (total patient dose 14.2 mg) oral
  - **Consider nebulised adrenaline** if persistent or worsening symptoms.

### Disposition
- Children can be discharged home once stridor-free at rest.
- A period of **observation of 3 hours** is required after nebulised adrenaline to ensure no recurrence of symptoms.
- Consider longer observation for children who:
  - Present overnight
  - Have limited access to medical care
  - Present with stridor more than once during the same illness
  - Have risk factors for severe croup.

### Further Considerations &amp; Follow-up
Consider consultation with the local pediatric team when:
- Severe airway obstruction is present.
- The child has risk factors or any doubt about the diagnosis.
- The child is less than 6 months of age.
- There is no improvement with nebulised adrenaline.

Consider transfer when:
- There is no improvement following nebulised adrenaline.
- The child requires repeated doses of nebulised adrenaline.
- The child needs care above the comfort level of the local hospital.
