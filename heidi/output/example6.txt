The guidelines for treating moderate croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), likely viral in origin, were published online by the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne. The full filename of the source document is `www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/croup_laryngotracheobronchitis`.

### Management

#### Investigations
- Croup is a clinical diagnosis. Investigations such as respiratory swab or nasopharyngeal aspirate, X-rays, and blood tests are **not indicated** in typical presentations. Consider appropriate investigations if there is concern for differential diagnoses.

#### Treatment
1. **Minimise distress** to avoid worsening symptoms, minimise interventions including examination and investigation that are not going to impact acute management.
2. Keep child with carers to reduce distress.
3. Try to keep the environment quiet, moderate lighting.
4. Children will adopt a position of comfort that minimises airway obstruction; do not change this.

5. **Medication**
   - **Moderate:**
     - Oral steroids: Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg oral or prednisolone 1 mg/kg oral.
     - Consider nebulised adrenaline if persistent or worsening symptoms.

#### Disposition
- Children can be discharged home once stridor free at rest.
- A period of observation of 3 hours is required after nebulised adrenaline to ensure no recurrence of symptoms.
- Consider a longer period of observation for children who:
  - Present overnight
  - Have limited access to medical care
  - Present with stridor more than once during the same illness
  - Have risk factors for severe croup.

### Further Considerations
- **Consultation with local pediatric team when:**
  - Severe airway obstruction present.
  - Child has risk factors or any doubt about diagnosis.
  - Child less than 6 months of age.
  - No improvement with nebulised adrenaline.

- **Transfer considerations:**
  - No improvement following nebulised adrenaline.
  - Child requiring repeated doses of nebulised adrenaline.
  - Child requiring care above the level of comfort of the local hospital.
