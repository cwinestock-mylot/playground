Acetylcysteine 200 mg/kg (total patient dose 1060.0 mg) over 4 hours in crystalloid solution 7 mL/kg (up to 500 mL) intravenously.\n  2. Acetylcysteine 100 mg/kg (total patient dose 530.0 mg) over the next 16 hours in crystalloid solution 14 mL/kg (up to 1000 mL) intravenously.\n  - For massive paracetamol exposures, double the second dose if paracetamol concentration is &gt;2 times the nomogram.\n\n**Ongoing Care and Management:**\n- Ingestions involving longer-acting forms of paracetamol (modified release) should be discussed with Poisons Information Centre or a clinical toxicologist.\n\n### Further Considerations:\n- Monitor for side effects such as gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting).\n- Follow-up should include repeat monitoring of liver function and paracetamol concentration if clinically indicated.\n\nThis comprehensive summary includes essential details from the guidelines regarding the management of Paracetamol overdose, focusing on investigations, treatment protocols, and follow-up considerations."
