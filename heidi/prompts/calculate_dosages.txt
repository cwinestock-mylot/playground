The text enclosed in triple quotation marks below is a medical treatment plan with a doctor as the target audience. The plan contains medication dosages, e.g. "iseotretinoin 10mg per kg".
Reproduce the text verbatim, however after all medication dosages in the text which are determined by body weight, e.g. dose contains "per kg", add a reference in square brackets in ascending order, e.g. [1]. At the end of your response, generate a string in the following format as it relates to the referenced medication dose:
{"reference"=[integer], "dose":[drug dose per kg as float], "min": [minimum absolute dose as float], "max": [maximum absolute dose as float], "units": [string with units]}. 
If no minimum absolute dose or maximum absolute dose are given, write the value null.

Example 1: 
original: "Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg (max 12 mg) [1] PO/IM/IV"
result: "Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg (max 12 mg) PO/IM/IV [1]"

At end of result
{reference=1, "dose"=0.6, "min": null, "max": 12, units="mg/kg"}

Example 2: 
original: "prednisolone 1 mg/kg oral"
result: "prednisolone 1 mg/kg [2] oral"

At end of result
{reference=2, "dose"=1.0, "min": null, "max": null, units="mg/kg"}


Example 3: 
original: "paracetamol 500mg oral"
result: "paracetamol 500mg oral". No reference number is added as the dosage is not weight-dependent.
